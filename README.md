# Flowmeter

Flowmeter aims to enhance the standard mechanical way of measuring pulmonary capacity by merging it with a smartphone's capability. It is part of the "big three", with Smartpatch and Flowmeter being the other two.

The big three were part of the published paper in 2016, "Development of Smart Phone Tools for Printed Diagnostics: Challenges and Solutions".

Big thanks to Dr. Richard Fletcher!
